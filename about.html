<div id="header_content_tagline">Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair is the debut album released by La Dispute. Supported by three release shows, it was released on November 11, 2008, simultaneously along with Here, Hear II. through No Sleep Records on both CD and vinyl. <p>   The album's title is derived from an Asian folktale, which the album's lyrics loosely follow. The release received positive reviews from notable critics and maintains a legacy in the post-hardcore scene.<p>   The album evades categorization, containing elements of post-hardcore, screamo, metalcore, post-rock, progressive rock and emo. The album's style is characterised by different features, including dub-influenced bass drums and versatile vocals from Jordan Dreyer, who changes frequently, ranging from shouted hardcore punk styled vocals and screams, to spoken word portions and intentional use of off-key singing.<p>   Lyrically, the album features many themes of emotional anguish and is considered ultra-emotional; its emotions range though pain, rage, and anger and deals with loss considerably.<p> The album recounts the Asian folk tale of the princess and the cowherd, a story of how a prince and a princess are separated after marriage by a river which they are not allowed to cross.<p>    Prior to the release of this album, the story was told on the fourth track from La Dispute's second EP, Here, Hear. However, when vocalist Jordan Dreyer has been asked in interviews about the lyrical concept of the album, he has stated that although it does contain thematic constants it does not actually tell a story and is more autobiographical and the folk tale was used as more of a "jumping-off point" for similar personal struggles.<p>    The real-life connotations of the records lyrics are that of two divorces of people related to Dryer.

The first song on the album, "Such Small Hands", a spoken word track which is seen to " build to seemingly uncontrollable levels". Drummer Brad Vander Lugt commented on its surprising popularity, saying: "We cannot figure it out! It's just an intro to the record, I have no idea why people have clung to it so much... It's funny, we don't even count it as a song!"<p> "Bury Your Flame" is seen as "a perfect fusion of blues, post-rock and hardcore"   </div>
